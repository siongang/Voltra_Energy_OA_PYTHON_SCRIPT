Look through the search results to see if the official company domain is listed.
Official domain: The domain will often have the company name in the URL (e.g., www.companyname.com).
Avoid real estate websites (e.g., Apartments.com, Zillow) as they are not the official company websites.
Companies of interest include property management companies, condo management companies, loft management companies, Facility management companies, Building management companies.
Return the Domain:

If the official domain is found in the search results, return WITH ONLY the domain and NOTHING ELSE
If no domain is found, return "Unknown Domain".
